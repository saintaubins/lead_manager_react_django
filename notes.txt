pip install pipenv

pipenv shell

pipenv install django djangorestframework django-rest-knox

django-admin startproject leadmanager

cd leadmanager

python manage.py startapp leads

go to settings.py installed apps, insert: 'leads', 'rest_framework', 

go make a model in leads api, in class form

we need to now make a migration, python manage.py makemigrations, python manage.py migrate.

go into leads api, create serilizers.py and inster the Serializer class.

now make an api file in the leads api, called api.py

next we will create the urls, start with the root url.

then create a leads, url.py

we should now have a basic crud api, we can run the server.

after debug we can test it out with postman.
